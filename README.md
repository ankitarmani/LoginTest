# LoginTest
Testing the login page of android app using Robotium (no backend)


I have created a sample project which gives you an overview on how to integrate and test the GUI of an android application with Robotium Testing framework. In this project, one can see the demo login project (without backend) which is created from Android Studio IDE. 

AndroidManifest.xml, ApplicationTest.java and build.gradle (LoginTest/app/build.gradle) files are useful and important to understand this demo.
